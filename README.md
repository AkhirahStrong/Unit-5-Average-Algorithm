# Unit-5-Average-Algorithm

Average Algorithm

Task: Write pseudocode and draw a flowchart for the following algorithm.

The Algorithm: Given an array of numbers, find the average of all the positive numbers. Ignore the negative numbers.

Submission: The Pseudocode can be in a text file. The diagram should be a photo or screenshot.

Example:
Here is an example of pseudocode and a flowchart for an algorithm that finds the sum of all numbers in an array. This could provide you with a start for your own solution to the above exercise. We are not very particular about the exact syntax or symbols you use.


Pseudocode Example

START
Input array
Set sum = 0
Loop through array elements
	Add element value to sum
Output sum
END
